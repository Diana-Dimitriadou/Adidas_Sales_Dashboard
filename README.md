# Adidas_Sales_Dashboard
Interactive Excel Project

 I am excited to share my first interactive excel dashboard. It is a guided project from Ismaila Abdul Mum'in about Adidas Sales, 
 where I've done data cleaning with Power Queries and data analyzing with Pivot Tables. And I've created an interactive dashboard 
 in which I answered the below questions:
 
1. Which Product contributed more to Revenue?
2. Which State should we push more Products to?
3. What is the peak month for 2020 and 2021?
4. What's our top Region & Sales Channel?
5. Revenue trend by Weekday

Some Key Insights:
1. Street Footwear contributed more to Total Revenue than Apparels or Athletic Footwear.
   Also women purchased more of apparel products, while men purchased more of street footwear.
2. New York, California, Florida and Texas need more focus as they contributed 26% to revenue out of 50 states. 
3. April is the peak month for 2020 with $3.193.081, while the peak month for 2021 is Julie with $10.368.031.
   Which means that the Total Revenue increased 31% in 2021. 
4. The most Revenue came from the West Region and Online Sales Channel.  
5. Friday was the day of the week with the maximum revenue, $20M.
